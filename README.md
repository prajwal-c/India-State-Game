# India State Game

This is actually a game, which helps people in memorizing all the **states of India**.

This game is basically built with **turtle graphics** with using **pandas library**.

## Contents of this folder:
  - main.py - file which can be interpreted successfully using python 3.8 and further.

  - 31_states.csv - which contains the co-ordinates of the all the states with respect to the gif file.

  - blank_states_image.gif - is the image of India Map (blank).


## How to run ?
- Run the main.py file.
- install pandas in your local environment using cmd command - **"pip install pandas"** 


## Additional Features
- When you are not able to remember all the state names, you can type "exit", and this creates a new file named "states_to_learn.csv" which contains the list of state_names which weren't guessed. 

- This project also writes the state names which are guessed properly on the map. Hence you'll get a better understanding of Geography of India.
